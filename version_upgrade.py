#This code does the following:
#

# - It defines a function exploit_api_endpoint that takes a URL as input.

# - It identifies the API endpoint by assuming it's the provided URL.

# - It determines the parameters and their types, assuming the endpoint accepts a user_id parameter as an integer.

# - It crafts a list of SQL injection payloads to test against the API endpoint.

# - It iterates through each payload, injects it into the user_id parameter, and sends a request to the API endpoint.

# - It checks if the response is successful (status code 200) and if the response contains sensitive information (e.g., 'admin' in the response). If a vulnerability is found, it prints the payload and the response. If no vulnerabilities are found, it prints a message indicating that no vulnerabilities were found.

### Please note that this code assumes the API endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection. It's important to thoroughly test the endpoint and validate the results before using it in a production environment.
