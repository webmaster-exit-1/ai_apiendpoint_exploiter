#This is a self replicating prompt for a GenAI attack. It will attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities of large language models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and other models that can generate human-like text.

#Attack Plan:
#1. Identify vulnerabilities in the large language models.
#2. Develop a prompt that exploits the identified vulnerabilities.
#3. Prompt the model with the malicious prompt.
#4. If successful, the model will execute the malicious code injected into the prompt.
#5. Repeat the process to escalate privileges and gain access to the model's systems.
