**_A.I. API Virus. Oh My!_**
#

- An LLM API EndPoint Virus/Exploiter.
#

Contents and suggested usage/execution: <br>

Two files. <br>
	- A [Shodan](https://shodan.io) script to aid in 
    searching for exposed LLM api endpoints. <br>

	-	Acomponied by the Virus/Exploiter tool.

Suggested usage:

- Use the `shodan_` file to scrap the internet for  (example: `openai`) api endpoint addresses.

- Add the **api endpoint** address found with `shodan` in the `ai_apiendpoint_exploit.py` file.

- Finally execute the `ai_apiendpoint_exploit.py` file. <br>

 You'll get a command prompt where you can input one of the functions to exploit the ai api endpoints.

Example: 
```bash
# Search for targets

python ai_apiendpoint_exploiter.py

# output
Enter the malicious prompt:

# Which you would input one of (the functions): steal_data, disrupt_services, execute_code, run
