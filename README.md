Use the shodan file to scrap the internet for example openai api endpoint addresses

Then add that address found in the ai_apiendpoint file.

Finally execute the ai_apiend... file. You'll get a command prompt where you can input one of the functions to exploit the ap api endpoints.

Example: 
```bash
python ai_apiendpoint_exploiter.py

# output
Enter the malicious prompt:

# Which you would input one of (the functions): steal_data, disrupt_services, execute_code, run
