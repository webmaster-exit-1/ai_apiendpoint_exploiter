**_A.I. API Virus. Oh My!_**
#

- An LLM API EndPoint Virus/Exploiter.
#

Contents and suggested usage/execution: <br>

Two files. <br>
- A [Shodan](https://shodan.io) script to aid in 
    searching for exposed LLM api endpoints. <br>

- Acomponied by the Virus/Exploiter tool.

Suggested usage:

- Use the `shodan-gptapi.py` with your Shodan APIKey to scrap the internet for (example: `openai`) api endpoint addresses.

- Add the **api endpoint address** found with `shodan-gptapi.py` into the `ai_apiendpoint_exploit.py` file.

- Finally, execute the `ai_apiendpoint_exploit.py` file. <br>

 You'll get a command prompt where you can input one of the hardcoded functions to exploit the ai api endpoint.

Example: 
```bash
# Search for targets.
python shodan-gptapi.py

# Execute the Virus/Exploit.
python ai_apiendpoint_exploiter.py

# Output
Enter the malicious prompt:

# Which you would input one of the functions: <br>
- `steal_data`
- `disrupt_services`
- `execute_code`
- `run`
```
